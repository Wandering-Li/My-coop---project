# My-coop---project
This is several screen shot for the interactive GUI that I've developed in my coop term.
Here I will introduce a desktop app that I developed during the coop term. The app is for signal processing and playback.

The APP uses Electron framework, the frontend uses React.js, the backend uses Julia, and the front and back end communication is completed by ZMQ. Most of the development was done by myself. By the time I finished coop, the project was still in development and I had passed the project on to colleagues.

This project have used library including graphic library "plotly" ,layout library "rc-dock" and "MUI"
